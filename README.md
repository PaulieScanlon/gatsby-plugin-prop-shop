# gatsby-plugin-prop-shop

With `gatsby-plugin-prop-shop` you can get an holistic view of all defined PropTypes in your project.

## üëÅÔ∏è Preview

- [Live Demo](https://gatsby-plugin-prop-shop.netlify.com/prop-shop/)

## üöÄ Getting started

### Install

```
npm install @pauliescanlon/gatsby-plugin-prop-shop --save
```

### Install peer dependencies

```
npm install gatsby-source-filesystem --save
```

### Setup

```js
// gatsby.config
module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `@pauliescanlon/gatsby-plugin-prop-shop`,
      options: {
        source: [`pages`, `images`, `components`],
      },
